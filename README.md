# SkillIndia-NGS-Training
Practical NGS pipeline and analysis workflow learned during Skill India Genomics and Molecular Technologies training


This repository documents my **1-month training under the Skill India Programme** on the topic:  
**"Genomics and Molecular Technologies for Industrial Applications"**, conducted by **CSIR-IGIB**.  

During this training, I learned and practiced the **entire workflow of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis**, starting from basic Linux commands to genome classification and AMR detection.

## Folder Structure

| Step | Folder | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `01_Linux_Basics` | Basic Linux commands and environment setup |
| 2 | `02_QC_and_Trimming` | Quality check and trimming of sequencing reads |
| 3 | `03_Assembly` | Genome assembly for short and long reads |
| 4 | `04_Annotation` | Genome annotation using Prokka |
| 5 | `06_AMR_Detection` | Antimicrobial resistance gene detection |
| 6 | `05_Variant_Calling` | Variant detection using reference genome |
| 7 | `07_Classification` | Genome classification and taxonomy analysis |

## Notes

- **Short-read workflows** were completed fully, including QC, trimming, assembly, annotation, variant calling, AMR detection, and classification.  
- **Long-read workflows** were completed up to assembly due to hardware limitations.  
- All steps are reproducible using the **example data links** provided in the respective folders.  
- Each folder contains a **README.md** with detailed commands, notes, and references to data.
