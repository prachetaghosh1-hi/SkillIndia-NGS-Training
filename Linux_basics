## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why We Are Using Linux
- Linux can handle large data efficiently, which is essential in bioinformatics and NGS workflows.  
- It is stable, secure, and supports a wide range of command-line tools used in genomics.  
- Two popular Linux distributions (subsystems) are **Ubuntu** and **Kali**.  
- Linux organizes all directories in a **tree-like structure**.  
- In Linux, **folders are called directories**.

## üíª 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Install Ubuntu
I downloaded **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** from the Microsoft Store.  
While setting it up, I created a **username (ID)** and a **password**.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The password is very important. If forgotten, Ubuntu must be uninstalled and reinstalled.  

After installation, commands were practiced directly in Ubuntu.

- The command `rm -r` means **remove recursively** ‚Äî it deletes a folder and everything inside it (subfolders and files).  
- It is **permanent** and cannot be undone.

rm filename

# Remove a folder interactively (asks for confirmation)
rm -ri foldername
